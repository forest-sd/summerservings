<section class="hero"><div class="container"><h1>Nourishing Communities All Summer Long</h1><p>We believe every child deserves access to nutritious meals, even when school is out. Our summer meal programs bring fresh food to communities across the region.</p><a href="/programs/" class="btn">Our Programs</a></div></section><section><div class="container"><h2>Our Mission</h2><p>Summer Servings is dedicated to closing the nutrition gap that affects millions of children when school cafeterias close for the summer. During the school year, free and reduced-price meal programs provide critical nutrition for families in need. When summer arrives, that lifeline disappears. We bridge the gap by organizing community meal sites, mobile feeding programs, and family food boxes that ensure no child goes hungry during the break.</p><div class="grid"><div class="card"><h3>Community Meal Sites</h3><p>Free nutritious meals served at parks, libraries, and community centers throughout the summer months.</p></div><div class="card"><h3>Mobile Feeding</h3><p>Our mobile units bring meals directly to neighborhoods with limited access to meal sites.</p></div><div class="card"><h3>Family Food Boxes</h3><p>Weekly produce and pantry boxes for families, providing fresh ingredients for healthy home cooking.</p></div></div></div></section>
