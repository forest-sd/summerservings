Only a fraction — roughly one in seven — are reached by existing summer meal programs. The consequences extend beyond hunger itself. Children who experience food insecurity over summer show measurable learning loss, behavioral changes, and health impacts that persist into the fall. Studies show that summer meal programs don't just feed children — they reduce emergency room visits, improve reading scores, and strengthen the community organizations that host them. Closing the summer hunger gap isn't charity; it's an investment in our children's futures that pays dividends across education, healthcare, and community wellbeing.</p></div><div class="card"><h3>How Communities Are Innovating Summer Meals</h3><p>The traditional model of fixed meal sites with set hours leaves many children unreached — families without transportation, children in rural areas, and those whose schedules don't align with serving times. Communities are innovating with solutions that meet families where they are. Mobile meal trucks bring food to apartment complexes and neighborhoods. Text-to-locate services help families find the nearest meal site in real time. Grab-and-go options eliminate the requirement to eat on site. Evening and weekend meals supplement the traditional weekday model. And partnerships with farmers markets provide fresh produce alongside prepared meals. The common thread is flexibility — recognizing that hunger doesn't follow a schedule and neither should the solutions.</p></div></div></div></section>
